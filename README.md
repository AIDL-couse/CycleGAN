Project for the 2019 AIDL UPC course

Style Transfer Cycle GAN Project
Team: E. Bargalló, A. Navarro, R. Planas, N. Treviño
Advisor: D. Fojo

The github is structured in 2 folders, "Final Codes/" and "Former Versions/".

The "Final Codes" folder contains the main DL codes that have been used along the project developement.
The starting point was the MNIST Conditional GAN code.
Then, the Preliminary Style Transfer Cycle GAN code was performed, dealing with datasets with horses and zebras.
Then the Original Paper Cycle GAN was used as a ground truth to compare the results the team was obtaining.
And finally, the Final Style Transfer Cycle GAN code gathers all the improvements up to the project presentation.

The "Former Versions" folder contains, as the name states, other working versions concerning to the different codes.

The relevant technical explanations are included in every one of the files.
